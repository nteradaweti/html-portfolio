<h1>The Best Movies According to Ntembeko</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Pursuit of Happiness</h3>
<p>Most inspirational movie, showing how the dad would do absolutely anything to make sure that his child is well taken care of.</p>
<h3> FOCUS</h3>
<p>Art of persuasion personsified. The way they manipulate situations in the favour from knowing how human being function is truly fascinating.</p>
<h3>The Equaliser 3</h3>
<p>Denzil Washingtion just has a way of making every movie he is in so good, packed with action yet sentimental.</p>
